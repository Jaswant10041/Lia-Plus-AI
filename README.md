# Lia-Plus-AI.....Please read this Readme in full view mode for better Readability

1.To run The project
 1.1 Go to the Terminal and change directory to where your project need to be kept.....
 1.2 Run this Command 'git clone https://github.com/Jaswant10041/Lia-Plus-AI.git'
 1.3 Now write this command to go to vscode 'code .'
 1.4 First we run backend and we will run frontend.....
 1.5 Run the following commands 1. 'cd backend' 2. 'npm install' 3. 'nodemon App.js'
 1.6 Now your backend is runnning on port no 3000 and now we will run frontend......
 1.7 1. 'cd ..' 2. 'cd frontend' 3. 'npm install' 4. 'npm run dev'
 1.8 Now you see our website is running on given url in terminal.....
 
2.Can we both jump into my project..... are you ready........Here We go.....The beauty things about my project
  2.1 firstly i wrote code for backend and written api's and One thing that i implemented new is I used Import and Export rather than require and module.export (i.e it is not new but for me it is first time in            backend ) why i used them because they only import the code which required and also works asynchronously......
  2.2 For better understanding of code and better readability of code to anyone i implemented MVC architecture.........In Models I wrote code for DataBase like DB connecting,Schemas,Model creation for different           category.........I wrote whole actual logic in Components........I wrote routes logics inside Routes folder...........
  2.3 There is more to talk about frontend first i included vite bundler and Tailwind.......
  2.4 I created Forms to create and edit data..........Here i sended data to backend and backend is stored that data into db....
  2.5 Now i need data to show data right......So I fetched the data in useEffect and stored it on Global Context So that we can use Our Data whereever we needed......
  2.6 Here I did't use Normal way of Routing There are 3 different ways for Routing based on requirements. But I choosed the Data One......
  2.7 I lifted up the states where required........
  2.8 I used Lady Loading for Code Splitting for Faster User Performance........
  2.9 I used Link tag to navigate not anchor tag why because anchor tag makes it reload complete our webpage.......
  2.10 I used The provided api's to fetch,add,put,and delete the data......
  2.11 I implemented a small new feature that is if user clicks on add expense button multiple times fastly it will make multiple api calls that will add same data multiple times. To remove that problem I made it to disable for 2 seconds for better user experience and not going api calls for single data multiple times........
3. Apology From My side is I did't made a charts to visualize the data(I can)......Why because Right now i am doing internship in a startup....Here I was assigned by many tasks to do.......and I don't like writing fast codes I like thinking what happens in all different ways........
